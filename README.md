## Open Data Sources

* _**Availability and access**: the data must be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably by downloading over the internet. The data must also be available in a convenient and modifiable form._
* _**Reuse and redistribution**: the data must be provided under terms that permit reuse and redistribution including the intermixing with other datasets. The data must be machine-readable._
* _**Universal participation**: everyone must be able to use, reuse and redistribute — there should be no discrimination against fields of endeavour or against persons or groups. For example, ‘non-commercial’ restrictions that would prevent ‘commercial’ use, or restrictions of use for certain purposes (e.g. only in education), are not allowed._
